# pythonAssignments
This repo is created while taking saylani mass training for the submission of assignments.
As the theme of the asssignment submission is to add all the questions in a single  file so i have crated a single python file and atempted
all the questions in it, the code is heavily commented, while the code it self is encapuslated in DOC_STRINGS ''' just remove the doc strings
and run it.


peace*
